# CondRemit

## Overview

CondRemit is a decentralized Web3 platform built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. It enables secure, conditional remittances through escrow mechanisms, where funds (STX or SIP-10 fungible tokens) are locked and automatically released to recipients only when predefined conditions are met. This eliminates the need for trusted intermediaries, reduces fraud risks, and lowers costs compared to traditional remittance services like Western Union or bank wires.

The platform supports various condition types, such as time-based releases (e.g., funds unlock after a deadline), oracle-verified events (e.g., confirmation of goods delivery via an external data feed), and multi-signature approvals (e.g., requiring confirmations from multiple parties). Users interact via a simple dApp interface (not included in this codebase; can be built with Stacks.js), making it accessible for everyday remittances.

## Real-World Problems Solved

- **High Fees and Delays in Remittances**: Traditional services charge 5-10% fees and take days. CondRemit uses Stacks' low-cost transactions (anchored to Bitcoin) for near-instant, cheap transfers, ideal for cross-border payments to unbanked populations.
- **Trust and Fraud Risks**: Senders often worry about funds being misused. Escrow ensures release only on condition fulfillment, preventing scams in scenarios like freelance work (pay on approval), humanitarian aid (release on delivery proof), or family support (time-locked for emergencies).
- **Lack of Conditionality**: Standard crypto transfers are irreversible. CondRemit adds programmable logic, solving issues in e-commerce, escrow-based trades, or conditional donations (e.g., funds release if a milestone is met, verified by oracle).
- **Accessibility for Underserved Markets**: Targets developing regions with high remittance inflows (e.g., Philippines, Mexico), where blockchain can bypass corrupt intermediaries and provide transparency.
- **Dispute Handling**: Built-in multi-sig for resolutions, reducing reliance on courts or arbitrators.

By leveraging Stacks' security (inherited from Bitcoin), the project ensures immutable, auditable transactions while solving these pain points.

## Architecture

The system uses 6 smart contracts in Clarity:
1. **EscrowFactory.clar**: Factory for deploying and managing escrow instances.
2. **Escrow.clar**: Core escrow logic for locking/releasing funds.
3. **ConditionTrait.clar**: Trait (interface) for condition verifiers.
4. **TimeCondition.clar**: Handles time-based conditions (e.g., release after block height).
5. **OracleCondition.clar**: Integrates with oracles for external event verification.
6. **MultiSigCondition.clar**: Manages multi-signature approvals for conditions.

Contracts interact via traits for modularity. Funds are held in the Escrow contract, and conditions are verified by calling the respective condition contracts. Supports STX and SIP-10 tokens via standard transfers.

## Setup and Deployment

1. **Prerequisites**: Install Clarinet (Stacks dev tool) via `cargo install clarinet`.
2. **Project Structure**:
   - Clone or create a new Clarinet project: `clarinet new cond-remit`.
   - Add the contracts below to `./contracts/`.
   - Add dependencies in `Clarinet.toml` (e.g., for SIP-10 if using tokens).
3. **Testing**: Run `clarinet test` to execute unit tests (add your own based on the code).
4. **Deployment**: Use Clarinet to deploy to Stacks testnet/mainnet. Deploy trait first, then conditions, factory, and escrows.
5. **Integration**: Build a frontend with Stacks.js to call functions like `create-escrow`.

## Usage Example

- Sender calls `EscrowFactory.create-escrow` with recipient, amount, condition type (e.g., time), and params.
- Condition contract creates a verifier ID.
- To release: Call `Escrow.release` which checks the condition via trait.
- If condition met, funds transfer; else, revert or refund.

## Security Notes

- Audits recommended before mainnet.
- Oracle trust assumptions: Use decentralized oracles like Chainlink on Stacks (if integrated).
- Reentrancy protected via non-reentrant patterns.
- All contracts are ownable or use tx-sender for access control.
